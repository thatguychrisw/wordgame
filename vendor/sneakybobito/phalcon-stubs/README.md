Tested with Netbeans


Two solutions for adding phalcon stubs into your project : composer or clone+checkout.

Composer 
-----------

The simplest way to install stubs, is to use composer :

Add the line : ```"sneakybobito/phalcon-stubs": "1.2.0"``` in your ```composer.json``` and ```update``` or ```install```.

You may specify a different version :

```"sneakybobito/phalcon-stubs": "1.1.0"```  ```"sneakybobito/phalcon-stubs": "1.0.0"```




Clone and checkout
-----------

If you dont want to use composer, then you can just put the stubs in your project by cloning the repo manually.

Anywhere in you project you can clone the stubs :

```git clone https://github.com/SneakyBobito/phalcon-stubs.git```

then move to the version you want : 

```git checkout 1.2.0``` or ```git checkout 1.1.0``` or ```git checkout 1.0.0```





.gitignore

Dont forget to add it into you ```.gitignore```
